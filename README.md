My first CARE (Comprehensive Audit Readiness Evaluation) review performed 
in Secureum's Smart Contract Security Auditing Bootcamp. 
The review is done by me individually and aims to find as many issues as possible using the [Security Pitfalls & Best Practices 101](https://secureum.substack.com/p/security-pitfalls-and-best-practices-101) & [201](https://secureum.substack.com/p/security-pitfalls-and-best-practices-201) checklists.

You can read more about the review and the process [in this blogpost.](https://medium.com/p/be577eba49f8)

`CARE is not a replacement for a security audit, but is intended to technically happen 
before audit so that the protocol code becomes ready for future audit(s) 
and can get a better security outcome from the process.`

The review's timeframe was 2 weeks from December 5th to December 17th.
